# How to Get the Updated File with All 5 Categories

## ✅ FIXED: Percentage Dropdowns Implemented

I've changed the sqft inputs to percentage dropdowns as requested:
- Dropdown options: 10%, 20%, 30%, ..., 100%
- Default: 100% (full house)
- Calculation: (percentage / 100) × house_sqft × cost_per_sqft
- Example: 2000 sqft house, 60% flooring = 1200 sqft × $6.05/sqft = $7,260

## ⚠️ Important: Download from the CORRECT Branch

The updated file with percentage dropdowns is on:
**Branch:** `claude/explore-repository-011CULW5yU26WqzG48J42aHk`

**NOT on main yet** (I don't have permission to push to main)
